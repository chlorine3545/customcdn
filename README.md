Hello, I am Chlorine.

This repository contains some commonly used files, including fonts and JavaScript, etc., distributed using jsDelivr and its mirror sites in mainland China as a public welfare CDN. This file is provided to offer some necessary explanations.

## Copyright Statement

- All font files on this site are downloaded from platforms such as GitHub and Google Fonts, and are split using tools like the [Chinese Web Font Project Online Split Tool](https://chinese-font.netlify.app/online-split/). **All copyrights belong to the original authors of the fonts!**
- The JavaScript files on this site include original files and files from the internet. If you believe you hold the copyright to some of the code and do not agree with this method of storage and distribution, please contact me immediately via [email](mailto:yoghurtlee123@gmail.com).

## Nature of This Repository

**This repository is not a private CDN for accelerating images or resources but should be seen as a supplementary submission for public resources not directly included. Anyone can reference the resources in this repository through jsDelivr, etc., without violating laws, regulations, and platform-related provisions. I promise not to use the public welfare CDN for private purposes, nor will it be used as a tool for sharing large resources like an image hosting service without the permission of the manager.**
